# Data Structures Learning Repository
This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey as I learn about data structures.
Here, you'll find the code implementations and notes I've gathered to deepen my understanding of this fundamental topic in computer science.
# Generic Data Structures using Void pointers
In the global_ folder you will find the implemetations using _**Void Pointers
**_ for achieving genericity. These implementations allow you to work with various data types without the need for separate implementations for each type. these data structures can adapt to any data type, offering versatility and ease of use
